# AUA Utils v1.2.0

AUA Utils is a collection of minimalistic and clean utility scripts and tools designed to enhance the AUA web experience (official extension are available for Firefox and Chrome).

Plugins are separate code blocks that can work independently of the extension. They are cross-platform and can be installed using script injection extensions such as Tampermonkey. The AUA Utils Extension provides more capabilities and functionality, but for example, on Safari you can only install the plugins using Tampermonkey because AUA Utils extension is currently available for Safari.

AUA Utils Extension is the core part of the AUA Utils project. It represents the browser-based component that delivers the plugins directly inside AUA web platforms and serves as the main interface between the user and the overall AUA Utils ecosystem.
